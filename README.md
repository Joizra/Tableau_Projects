## Summary
Superstore, a company that provides office supplies, technology, and furniture, wants to know What are the products that are making the company waste money in each of its segments so that the executives of the company can design new strategies or make decisions.


## Methods
Tableau 2022 version 4 was used to analyze the data.

The data analyst designed a report that displays for each segment(Consumer, Corporate, Home Office, Small Business) the following:

* The total profit obtained by the company in the last trimester for each product in its category.
* The trend of the profit gained in the last trimester by each product.
* The store location where a product registers losses.



## Results
* Among the four segments, tables and bookcases of the furniture category show a loss in their profits of the last trimester. 
* Among the four categories, the technology category only wasted money in the consumer segment in the last trimester with the office machines and the copiers and faxes. However, the trend shows that both products are started to increase their profits.
